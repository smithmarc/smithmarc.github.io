### Neighborhood Map

This application shows the location of Steakhouses in the Joondalup area.

#### Instructions

Fortunately, this app requires no setup. Simply unzip the files to a location
of your choosing and run `index.html` in your favourite browser.

The app will run on most (nearly all) devices. If you are using a mobile device,
look for the menu button (the three bars) to hide the sidebar.

#### Main Functionality

The app has been hard-coded with five locations. These locations are Steakhouses
within the Joondalup area. The locations can be seen by their corresponding Google
Maps marker. Clicking on either the marker or the name of the restaurant in the list
view will bounce the marker and open an information window pertaining to the location
clicked.

The app also retrieves information using the Wikipedia API and has some error handling
capabilities.
